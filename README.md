I wrangle Python, talk to AIs, and build backend systems that (mostly) don’t explode under load. I love working on projects that combine my technical skills with real-world impact.

## 🧑‍🏫 Certifications & Learning
- 🎓 Graduated from Anna University with a CGPA of 8.5 — not too shabby, right?
- 📚 Currently power-leveling my dev game at Scaler Academy — deep-diving into DSA, SQL, HLD, LLD, MERN, and all things backend like a true code warrior.

## 🗣️ Leadership & Community
- 📣 Toastmasters – Division F Public Relations Officer (2019–2020). Yep, I used to talk a lot — now I just code and occasionally still talk.
- 🧑‍💻 Hackathons? Been there, built that. Led teams, squashed bugs, shipped demos, and had fun doing it.
- 🚀 Mentored juniors like a dev big bro — making sure no one gets left behind in the semicolon jungle.
